    <h3> Description of the game</h3>
    <p> There's no story for this game because its an original snake game</p>
    <p> This game dont have difficult because we don't have time to add the difficult for the game</p>
    <p> The game end if the snake touch the wall the game will end</p>
    <h3> Reflection Piece</h3>
    <p> I make the game because me and my partner just want to make a simple game but the snake game is not really simple by saying that the function to make the snake move is really hard and how to make the body cloning themselves and follow the head so we just delete the cloning part out</p>
    <p> 2 successful points are that i can make the snake move and when the mouse is eated the mouse can respawm randomly location</p>
    <p> 2 obstacles that make the game difficult are that the body of the snake because the body of the snake need to clone themselves by eating the mouses and the body need to follow the snake head</p>
    <p> If i have time i will make the game more perfect because i don't have time to add the function that make the body of the snake follow the head</p>
    <p> its the function to make the snake move because without it the game can work well</p>
